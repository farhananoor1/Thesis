Analyzing the Complexity of Natural Languages for Bot Detection

# Human vs. Bot Text Detection in Yoruba and Kashmiri Using Unsupervised NLP Techniques

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials for the master's thesis:

**Title:** *Distinguishing Human-Written and Bot-Generated Text in Under-Resourced Languages: A Study of Yoruba and Kashmiri*

**Author:** Noor Farhana  
**Program:** Master's in Data Science  
**Institution:** Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia  
**Year:** 2025

The project investigates unsupervised methods for identifying machine-generated versus human-authored text in morphologically rich but computationally underserved languages—specifically **Yoruba** and **Kashmiri**.

---

## Project Objectives

- Construct balanced corpora of human-written and GPT-generated texts in Yoruba and Kashmiri.
- Apply TF–IDF, Word2Vec, and FastText for vectorization.
- Use **Wishart clustering** and **SVD/PCA/t-SNE** for semantic structure analysis.
- Quantify complexity using the **Entropy–Complexity (H–C) Plane**.
- Validate whether linguistic patterns differ significantly between bot and human authorship.
